It is imperative that for an eCommerce company to be successful, it must be safe, reliable, accessible, and quick. Keeping these qualities in mind, here are our picks of the top fintech companies that are redefining the payment domain; 

 

* What are the other major companies in this domain? 

TenCent, Ali, PayPal; Stripe; TransferWise; Headnote; Flywire; Venmo; Square; Android pay, Bank of America  

  

## Results 

  

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? 

 The fact that experts believe 90% of the smartphone users will land on mobile payment method by the end of this year, is enough for startups and businesses that have invested in mobile app development to rethink about more payment gateways, Apple Credit Card integrated into Apple Pay being one of them. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? 

In the years since its launch, over 6.4 million people have become Apple Card users. J.D. Power even ranked Apple and Goldman Sachs as number one in customer satisfaction for midsize card issuers for two years straight. The Apple Card has definitely been a huge success for Apple. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? 

 a.) Goldman’s credit card business, anchored by the Apple Card since 2019, has arguably been the company’s biggest success yet in terms of gaining retail lending scale. It’s the largest contributor to the division’s 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances, a figure that Goldman said would nearly double to $30 billion by 2024. 

But rising losses threaten to mar that picture. Lenders deem bad loans “charge-offs” after a customer misses payments for six months; Goldman’s 2.93% net charge-off rate is double the 1.47% rate at JPMorgan’s card business and higher than Bank of America’s 1.60%, despite being a fraction of those issuers’ size. 

Goldman’s losses are also higher than that of Capital One, the largest subprime player among big banks, which had a 2.26% charge-off rate. 

b.) The card can be managed with the help of the Wallet app, which is also used for applying for the card. It gives users updated data on their spending patterns and helps them track. The Apple team yet again did it differently. The app color-codes recurring items you spend on and can track your weekly or monthly transactions with respect to locations they were transacted at.  Pretty much the most interesting Apple Credit Card benefit is it allows users to see on the map where they made the purchase, no merchant codes, only the store name on the map. This eliminates the problem that credit cards often showed minimal location information, up until now. Something that banks can learn a lot from. 

## Recommendations 

  

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 

 Apply apple card payment to other payment systems other than Apple Pay, I.e. Android Pay. Google Pay. 

QR code scan and pay. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? 

 a.) Online transaction is the new black  

If you own an E-commerce/M-Commerce business, then your business model relies on online sales. Here, Apple Pay for small businesses is a must-grab deal. Users can easily pay for their purchases with their Apple Card using Apple Pay -something that can help avoid the abandoned cart situation. 

Without restricting to the commerce domain, Apple Card as a payment option will work wonders for gaming applications, subscription-based applications such as entertainment and music, and of course on-demand mobility solutions, just to name a few. 

b.) Making payments using ‘Scan to Pay’ is extremely quick as compared to other modes of payment. All the user has to do is simply open the iMobile app, scan the QR code, and confirm to process the payment*. The payments are made within a few seconds. 
‘Scan to Pay’ is a highly secure method of payment because the QR code is nothing but just a tool that is used to exchange information. Any data which is transferred through QR codes is encrypted thus making the payment secure. Being a complete contactless payment option, it also offers additional safety to both, the user and the merchant. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? 

 No need of card, no need of cash, transaction secure and complete.
